Hello! Welcome to JotBot, a Google Chrome Extension used to extract text from images from your browser! 

To use or try out JotBot, download the repository, then navigate towards chrome://extensions. Enable developer mode, and press "load unpacked", selecting the unzipped JotBot folder to upload.

How does JotBot work? We used Chrome's capture tab function as well as Google Tesseract's OCR (Optical Character Recognition) capabilities to be able to extract information from your browser every time you click on the extension. 

Please feel free to ask questions or contact me, and thank you for visiting my project!
